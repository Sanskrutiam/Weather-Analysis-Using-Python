# Weather Analysis Using Python

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing weather data using Python. The goal is to provide insights into various weather parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) over time and identify trends and patterns. This project utilizes Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization to create interactive and informative graphs and charts.
##  Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x: Ensure Python is installed. Check with python --version.
2. pip: Python's package manager to install dependencies. Check with pip --version.
3. Weather Data: Access to an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) or static CSV/JSON data files.
4. Required Libraries: Install dependencies 
5. IDE/Text Editor: Use an IDE or text editor like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook.
6. Internet: Required for fetching real-time weather data via API.
## Installation

Download and install Python  from official website.

```bash

```
Open the -- file in any python text editor or IDE.
## Features

- Weather Data Collection: Fetch data from APIs or use static datasets (CSV/JSON).
- Data Cleaning: Clean and preprocess raw weather data.
- Data Analysis: Analyze weather parameters like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- Interactive Visualizations: Create interactive charts (e.g., line plots, bar charts, heatmaps) using Plotly Express.
- Trend Identification: Identify patterns and trends in weather data over time.

## Usage

Download Weather Data:

If using an API, update the main.py script with your API key and endpoint.
If using static data, place the CSV/JSON files in the data/ folder.
Run the Script:

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
python main.py
```


The script generates interactive visualizations and saves them in the images/ folder.


## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize weather data to identify trends and patterns in various weather parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed). By using Python and libraries like Plotly Express, the goal is to provide interactive, insightful visualizations that help understand weather behavior over time and across different regions.
