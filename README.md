# Weather-Analysis-Using-Python
#Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing weather data using Python. The goal is to provide insights into various weather parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) over time and identify trends and patterns. This project utilizes Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization to create informative graphs and charts.
#Key Features
Data Collection: Fetch weather data from a reliable API or dataset.
Data Cleaning: Preprocess and clean the raw weather data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Data Analysis: Analyze weather parameters, such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation, using statistical methods.
Data Visualization: Visualize weather trends using plots and charts (e.g., line plots, bar charts, heatmaps).
#Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Plotly Express: For creating interactive and dynamic visualizations.
NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
Requests: To fetch weather data from an external API (if applicable).
